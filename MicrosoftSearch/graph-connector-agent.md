# Microsoft Graph connector agent

Using on-premises connectors requires installing *Microsoft Graph connector agent* software. It allows for secure data transfer between on-premises data and the connector APIs. This article guides you through installing and configuring the agent.

## Installation

Download the latest version of the Microsoft Graph connector agent from [https://aka.ms/GCAdownload](https://aka.ms/gcadownload) and install the software by using the installation configuration assistant. Release notes of the connector agent software are available [here](./graph-connector-agent-releases.md)

Using the recommended configuration of the machine described below, the connector agent instance can handle up to three connections. Any connections beyond that might degrade the performance of all connections on the agent.

Recommended configuration:

* Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 R2 and above
* [.Net Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [.NET Core Desktop Runtime 3.1 (x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
* 8 cores, 3 GHz
* 16 GB RAM, 2 GB Disk Space
* Network access to data source and internet through 443

If your organization's proxy servers or firewalls block communication to unknown domains, add the following rules to the 'allow' list:

1. *.servicebus.windows.net
2. *.events.data.microsoft.com
3. https://<span>login.microsoftonline.</span>com
4. https://<span>gcs.office.</span>com/
5. https://<span>graph.microsoft.</span>com/

>[!NOTE]
>Proxy authentication is not supported. If your environment has a proxy that requires authentication, we recommend allowing the connector agent to bypass the proxy using an authorized domain service account to logon to the service.

## Create and configure an app for the agent  

First, sign-in and note that the minimum required privilege on the account is search administrator. The agent will then ask you to provide authentication details. 
Use the steps below to create an app and generate the required authentication details.

### Create an app

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with admin credentials for the tenant.

2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** -> **App registrations** from the navigation pane and select **New registration**.

3. Provide a name for the app and select **Register**.

4. Make a note of the application (client) ID.

5. Open **API permissions** from the navigation pane and select **Add a permission**.

6. Select **Microsoft Graph** and then **Application permissions**.

7. Search for the following permissions and select **Add permissions**.

   | **Permission** | **When is the permission required** |
   | ------------- | -------------|
   | [ExternalItem.ReadWrite.OwnedBy](/graph/permissions-reference#application-permissions-52) | Always |
   | [Directory.Read.All](/graph/permissions-reference#application-permissions-23) | Required for File share, MS SQL and Oracle SQL connectors |

8. Select **Grant admin consent for [TenantName]** and confirm by selecting **Yes**.

9. Check that the permissions are in the "granted" state.

### Configure authentication

You can provide authentication details using a client secret or a certificate. Follow the steps of your choice.

#### Configuring the client secret for authentication

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with admin credentials for the tenant.

2. Open **App Registration** from the navigation pane and go to the appropriate App. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates and secrets**.

3. Select **New Client secret** and select an expiry period for the secret. Copy the generated secret and save it because it won't be shown again.

4. Use this Client secret and the application ID to configure the agent. Alphanumeric characters are accepted. You can't use blank spaces in the **Name** field of the agent.

#### Using a certificate for authentication

There are three simple steps for using certificate-based authentication:

1. Create or obtain a certificate
2. Upload the certificate to the Azure portal
3. Assign the certificate to the agent

##### Step 1: Get a certificate

You can use the script below to generate a self-signed certificate. Your organization may not allow self-signed certificates. In that case, use this information to understand the requirements and acquire a certificate according to your organization's policies.

```powershell
$dnsName = "<TenantDomain like agent.onmicrosoft.com>" # Your DNS name
$password = "<password>" # Certificate password
$folderPath = "D:\New folder\" # Where do you want the files to get saved to? The folder needs to exist.
$fileName = "agentcert" # What do you want to call the cert files? without the file extension
$yearsValid = 10 # Number of years until you need to renew the certificate
$certStoreLocation = "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
$expirationDate = (Get-Date).AddYears($yearsValid)
$certificate = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName $dnsName -CertStoreLocation $certStoreLocation -NotAfter $expirationDate -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature
$certificatePath = $certStoreLocation + '\' + $certificate.Thumbprint
$filePath = $folderPath + '\' + $fileName
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $password -Force -AsPlainText
Export-Certificate -Cert $certificatePath -FilePath ($filePath + '.cer')
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $certificatePath -FilePath ($filePath + '.pfx') -Password $securePassword
```

##### Step 2: Upload the certificate to the Azure portal

1. Open the application and navigate to certificates and secrets section from left pane.

2. Select **Upload certificate** and upload the .cer file.

3. Open **App registration** and select **Certificates and secrets** from the navigation pane. Copy the certificate thumbprint.

##### Step 3: Assign the certificate to the agent

Using the sample script to generate a certificate would save the PFX file in the location identified in the script.

1. Download the certificate pfx file onto the Agent machine.

2. Double-click the pfx file to launch the certificate installation dialog.

3. Select **Local Machine** for store location while installing the certificate.

4. After installing the certificate, open **Manage computer certificates** through the **Start** menu.

5. Select the newly installed certificate under **Personal** > **Certificates**.

6. Select and hold (or right-click) on the certificate and select **All Tasks** > **Manage Private Keys** Option.

7. In the permissions dialog, select add option. It pops up a new window. Select the 'Locations' option in it. Select the machine on which agent is installed among the listed locations shown and select **Ok**.

8. In the user selection dialog, write: **NT Service\GcaHostService** and select **Ok**. Don't select the **Check Names** button.

9. Select ok on the permissions dialog. The agent machine is now configured for the agent to generate tokens using the certificate.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation failure

If there's an installation failure, check the installation logs by running: msiexec /i "< path to msi >\GcaInstaller.msi" /L*V "< destination path >\install.log". If the errors aren't resolvable, send an email to support via MicrosoftGraphConnectorsFeedback@service.microsoft.com with the logs.

### Registration failure

If signing in to configure the application fails and shows the error: "Sign-in failed, please select the sign-in button to try again," even after browser authentication succeeded, then open services.msc and check if GcaHostService is running. If it doesn't start, start it manually.

When the service fails to start with the error "The service didn't start due to a logon failure," check if the virtual account: "NT Service\GcaHostService" has permission to sign in as a service on the machine. Check [this link](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/log-on-as-a-service) for instructions. If the option to add a user or group is greyed out in the Local Policies\User Rights Assignment, it means that the user trying to add this account doesn't have admin privileges on this machine, or there's a group policy overriding it. The group policy needs to be updated to allow the host service to log on as a service.

### Connection failure

If the 'Test connection' action fails while creating a connection and shows the error: 'Please check username/password and the data source path', even when the provided username and password are correct, then ensure that the user account has interactive sign in rights to the machine where the connector agent is installed. You can review the documentation about [logon policy management](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/allow-log-on-locally#policy-management) to check sign in rights. Also, ensure that the data source and the agent machine are on the same network.

If the following failure message appears when creating a connection: "1011: The Graph connector agent isn't reachable or offline.", sign in to the machine where the agent is installed and check if it's running. If the agent isn't running, start the agent application. If the connection continues to fail, verify that the certificate or client secret provided to the agent during registration hasn't expired and has required permissions.
